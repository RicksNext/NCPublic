# NextCounts v3 HTML
This is the entirety of the NextCounts HTML and JS code. This **does not** include the API code, only the front-end hosted in the main domain, nextcounts.com .

------------


## What is this?
Since NextCounts v3 will soon be replaced by v4 - even tho it is still the current version - I thought "why not make this public?", so here it is! The entire HTML Source Code for NextCounts!

## Why?
What powers NextCounts is the API so there isn't any secrets here.. I guess..

The "Averages" code was made public by me a while ago when I sent the files to Subscriber Wars and other stats streamers, so there isn't any secret anymore lol

## Is anything else becoming open-source anytime soon?
At the moment, I don't think I'll be making anything else NextCounts-related open-source.

## Is this code actively mantained?
Yes! Every change made here has effect in the public version of NextCounts hosted in the main website - nextcounts.com - so this will be updated as new updates come to NC as long as v3 is the current public version.

## When will v3 get discontinued?
I can't really answer that since I haven't even started coding v4 (v4 is currently in the planning phase), but I will notify on the NextCounts Insider Twitter account (@NCInsiders) when I decide to abandon v3 and start mantaining v4.

## Can I use this code to make my own Live Counts website?
I woudn't recommend that, since this code is subject to changes at any moment without notice, but do as you will, I'm not going to stop you lol
